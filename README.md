# API Testing Portfolio for JSONPlaceholder

This repository showcases my practical skills in API testing using **Postman**. The tests are performed against the public REST API provided by **JSONPlaceholder**, a popular service for testing and prototyping.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:
*   Create and document API tests.
*   Work with different HTTP methods (GET, POST).
*   Validate server responses, including status codes and response bodies.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents:

This project includes the following key artifacts:

*   **[API Test Cases](API_Test_Cases.md):** A document containing detailed, step-by-step test cases for key API endpoints.
*   **Postman Collection (`API_Portfolio_Collection.json`):** An exported Postman collection file. This file can be directly imported into Postman to run the API requests I've prepared.

### ðŸš€ How to Use the Postman Collection:

1.  Download the `API_Portfolio_Collection.json` file from this repository.
2.  Open your Postman application.
3.  Click on the `Import` button.
4.  Select the downloaded `.json` file.
5.  The "API Testing Portfolio" collection will now be available in your workspace.
