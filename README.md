# API Testing Portfolio for ReqRes.in

This repository showcases my practical skills in API testing using **Postman**. The tests are performed against the public REST API provided by [reqres.in](https://reqres.in), a widely used service for testing client-side applications.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create and document API tests, check different HTTP methods, and validate server responses.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents:

This project includes the following key artifacts:

*   **[API Test Cases](API_Test_Cases.md):** A document containing detailed, step-by-step test cases for key API endpoints, including expected results.
*   **Postman Collection (`ReqRes.postman_collection.json`):** An exported Postman collection file. This file can be directly imported into Postman to run the API requests I've prepared.

### ðŸš€ How to Use the Postman Collection:

1.  Download the `ReqRes.postman_collection.json` file from this repository.
2.  Open your Postman application.
3.  Click on the `Import` button (usually in the top-left corner).
4.  Select the downloaded `.json` file.
5.  The "ReqRes API Portfolio" collection will now be available in your workspace for you to run and inspect the requests.
